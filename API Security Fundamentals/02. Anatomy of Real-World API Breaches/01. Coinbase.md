**1. Overview of the Coinbase Incident**

- **Platform:** Coinbase is a major cryptocurrency exchange platform that facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of various cryptocurrencies.
- **Discovery:** A security researcher discovered a significant vulnerability that allowed unauthorized cryptocurrency trading. This researcher was awarded Coinbase's largest-ever bug bounty as a result.

**2. Attack Mechanism**

- **Traffic Analysis:**
  - **Reverse Engineering:** The researcher analyzed the communication traffic between Coinbase's web interface and its backend servers. This process involved capturing and inspecting the data packets exchanged during interactions.
  - **API Call Identification:** During this analysis, the researcher identified key API calls and parameters that were used in transactions.

- **Parameters Identified:**

![](/API%20Security%20Fundamentals/images/0a87883-7b05-36fe-de70-b8627604552_15.jpg)

  1. **Product ID:** Represents the cryptocurrency being traded (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
  2. **Order Type:** Specifies the nature of the transaction (e.g., sell, buy).
  3. **Source Account:** The account from which the cryptocurrency is being sold.
  4. **Target Account:** The account to which the cryptocurrency is being transferred.

- **Exploitation Technique:**
  - **Parameter Manipulation:** The researcher was able to manipulate these parameters to execute a trade from an account they did not own. They altered the source account parameter in the API call to bypass standard authorization checks.
  - **Web Interface Limitation:** This manipulation was not possible through the Coinbase web interface, which had adequate safeguards, but was feasible directly through API calls.

- **Successful Exploit:** The researcher successfully completed transactions involving cryptocurrencies from accounts they did not own, demonstrating a critical security flaw in the API.

**3. OWASP Attack Type**

- **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA):**
  - **Classification:** This vulnerability maps to OWASP API Security Top 10 ([API1:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/)), known as Broken Object Level Authorization.
  - **Description:** BOLA occurs when APIs fail to properly enforce authorization checks, allowing users to perform actions or access data they should not be permitted to. In this case, the API allowed unauthorized trading by bypassing necessary ownership checks.

**4. Response and Remediation**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Service Shutdown:** Coinbase temporarily shut down the affected service to prevent further exploitation and assess the impact.
  - **Issue Replication:** The Coinbase security team replicated the issue to understand the vulnerability better and to identify the root cause.
  - **Fix Implementation:** A fix was developed and deployed to address the vulnerability. This included adding necessary authorization checks to ensure that only legitimate account holders could execute transactions.
  - **Service Restoration:** The service was brought back online the following day after the fix was implemented.

- **Public Disclosure:**
  - **Blog Post:** Coinbase issued a detailed blog post about the incident, explaining the nature of the vulnerability, the steps taken to resolve it, and the lessons learned.

- **Root Cause Analysis:**

  - **Missing Validation Check:** The vulnerability was traced to a missing logic validation check in Coinbase's brokerage application. The application did not verify that the user initiating the transaction was the owner of the accounts involved.
  - **BOLA Flaw:** The flaw allowed one user to act on behalf of another user, leading to unauthorized trading activities.

- **Post-Fix Validation:**
  - **Enhanced Logic:** After the fix was applied, the system included logic to ensure that the source account in any transaction request must match the account associated with the product ID. This prevented unauthorized transactions from occurring.

**5. Lessons Learned**

- **Importance of Authorization Checks:**
  - **Robust Controls:** APIs must implement rigorous authorization checks to ensure that users can only perform actions on resources they own or have explicit permission to access.
  - **Preventative Measures:** Regular security assessments and testing are essential to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in API designs.

- **Proactive Monitoring and Testing:**
  - **Continuous Monitoring:** Organizations should continuously monitor API traffic and perform regular security testing to detect and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
  - **Vulnerability Management:** Effective vulnerability management practices include prompt detection, thorough analysis, and swift remediation to minimize the impact of security issues.

- **Transparent Incident Management:**
  - **Effective Communication:** Transparent communication with stakeholders and the public helps maintain trust and demonstrates the organizationâ€™s commitment to security and accountability.
  - **Incident Response:** A well-coordinated incident response plan ensures that security breaches are managed effectively, with minimal disruption to services and protection of user data.
