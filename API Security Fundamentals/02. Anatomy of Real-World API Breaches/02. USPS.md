**1. Overview of the US Postal Service Incident**

- **Platform:** The US Postal Service (USPS) operates a service called Informed Visibility, which provides users with access to their account information, mail scans, and other details.
- **Discovery:** Despite regular annual web vulnerability scans and initial fixes, a significant API vulnerability was discovered that allowed unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**2. Attack Mechanism**

- **API Overview:**
  - **Informed Visibility API:** This API was designed to allow users to access their own account information and mail scans. Users could sign up and authenticate to use the service.

- **Vulnerability Details:**
  - **Authentication vs. Authorization:** While the USPS had implemented authentication mechanisms to ensure users could log in, they did not fully implement proper authorization controls.
  - **Unrestricted Access:** Once a user authenticated, they could access not only their own records but also the records of other users, including those with any address in the system. This lack of authorization control exposed a vast amount of personal data.

- **Impact:**
  - **Data Exposure:** The flaw allowed unauthorized access to the records of approximately 60 million user accounts. This is a clear example of Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), where users can access data belonging to other users without proper restrictions.

**3. OWASP Attack Type**

- **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA):**
  - **Classification:** This incident maps to OWASP API Security Top 10 ([API1:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/)), known as Broken Object Level Authorization.
  - **Description:** BOLA vulnerabilities occur when APIs allow authenticated users to access or manipulate data that they are not authorized to interact with. In this case, the API did not restrict access based on user permissions, allowing users to view others' data.

**4. Response and Remediation**

- **Initial Actions:**
  - **Vulnerability Detection:** The issue was discovered after an attacker exploited the vulnerability to access unauthorized records.
  - **Fix Implementation:** USPS addressed the problem by implementing proper authorization checks to ensure that users could only access their own records.

- **Post-Fix Validation:**
  - **Enhanced Controls:** The USPS updated their API to include robust authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to other users' information.
  - **Ongoing Testing:** Additional testing and validation were conducted to ensure that the new controls were effective in preventing similar issues in the future.

**5. Lessons Learned**

- **Importance of Authorization Controls:**
  - **Comprehensive Security Testing:** Authentication alone is insufficient for securing APIs. Authorization controls must be properly implemented to ensure users only access data they are permitted to.
  - **Full API Testing:** Regular vulnerability scans should be complemented by thorough testing of API endpoints to identify and address authorization issues.

- **Data Protection:**
  - **Sensitive Information Management:** APIs that handle sensitive information must have stringent authorization and access control measures to protect user privacy and data security.

- **Incident Response:**
  - **Effective Remediation:** Swift and effective response to vulnerabilities is crucial for minimizing data exposure and restoring trust.
  - **Transparency:** Communicating the nature of the breach and the steps taken to resolve it helps maintain user trust and demonstrates a commitment to security.
