**1. Overview of the Instagram Incident**

- **Platform:** Instagram is a popular social media platform that allows users to share photos and videos, and interact with others through various features including account management.
- **Incident:** A vulnerability in Instagram's API allowed attackers to exploit the password reset functionality, leading to potential account takeovers.

**2. Attack Mechanism**

- **API Exploit:**
  - **Password Reset Process:** When a user requests a password reset, Instagram sends a six-digit reset code via email. This code can be submitted through an API to reset the password.
  - **Exploitation Method:** The attacker requested a reset code for another user's account. Although the code was not received via email, the attacker could attempt to brute-force the code through the API.

- **Vulnerability Details:**
  - **Broken Authentication ([API2:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa2-broken-authentication/)):**
    - **Description:** The API allowed the reset code to be submitted without sufficient authentication controls. The lack of comprehensive rate limiting and IP address restrictions enabled brute-force attacks.

  - **Excessive Data Exposure ([API3:2019](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa3-excessive-data-exposure/)):**
    - **Description:** Although not directly related to data exposure, the lack of proper controls allowed attackers to exploit the system and gain access to user accounts. The exposed vulnerability facilitated unauthorized access to account functionalities.

  - **Unrestricted Resource Consumption ([API4:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa4-unrestricted-resource-consumption/)):**
    - **Description:** Instagram implemented rate controls limiting the number of guesses to 200 per IP address. However, there was no restriction on the number of guesses across multiple IP addresses. This allowed attackers to rotate IP addresses and perform brute-force attacks using up to 5,000 IPs, leading to successful account takeovers.

**3. Response and Remediation**

- **Initial Actions:**
  - **Vulnerability Discovery:** The researcher reported the vulnerability, and Instagram took action to address the issue.
  - **Rate Limiting Enhancement:** Instagram introduced additional rate limiting controls to prevent brute-force attacks. They implemented stricter limits on password reset attempts from multiple IP addresses.

- **Additional Measures:**
  - **Reset Code Expiration:** Instagram implemented expiration policies for reset codes to reduce the time window during which they could be exploited.
  - **IP Address Restrictions:** Instagram introduced mechanisms to detect and mitigate attempts to rotate IP addresses for brute-force attacks.

**4. Lessons Learned**

- **Improving Authentication Controls:**
  - **Rate Limiting:** Implement comprehensive rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.
  - **IP Address Monitoring:** Monitor and restrict attempts from multiple IP addresses to detect and prevent coordinated attacks.

- **Enhancing Security Practices:**
  - **Expiration Policies:** Ensure that temporary codes or tokens have expiration times to limit the opportunity for exploitation.
  - **Secure Development:** Design APIs with robust security controls, including proper authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, to prevent vulnerabilities.

- **Incident Response:**
  - **Prompt Remediation:** Act swiftly to address identified vulnerabilities and implement necessary security measures.
  - **Transparency and Communication:** Communicate the details of the breach and the corrective actions taken to users and stakeholders to maintain trust and demonstrate commitment to security.
