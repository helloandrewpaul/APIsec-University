**1. Overview of the Bumble Incident**

- **Platform:** Bumble is a popular dating app that facilitates user interactions and matchmaking.
- **Incident:** A significant vulnerability in Bumbleâ€™s API led to the exposure of personal information for 95 million users.

**2. Attack Mechanism**

- **API Exploit:**
  - **Broken Object Level Authorization ([API1:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/)):**
    - **Description:** The attacker exploited broken object level authorization by accessing user records they should not have been able to see. The API did not adequately enforce permissions on data objects, allowing attackers to view records of other users without proper authorization.

  - **Broken Authentication ([API2:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa2-broken-authentication/)):**
    - **Description:** The API lacked proper authentication controls, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive information. This vulnerability falls under broken authentication, where inadequate or absent authentication measures permit unauthorized data access.

  - **Excessive Data Exposure ([API3:2019](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa3-excessive-data-exposure/))):**
    - **Description:** The API returned detailed user information, including distances between the requester and the user being searched. This allowed attackers to pinpoint user locations by creating multiple accounts, demonstrating excessive data exposure.

  - **Broken Function Level Authorization ([API5:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa5-broken-function-level-authorization/)):**
    - **Description:** The attacker exploited function-level authorization issues, gaining access to functionalities such as updating or deleting user records. This meant unauthorized users could perform actions beyond their permissions, such as changing account types from free to premium without payment.

**3. Response and Remediation**

- **Initial Actions:**
  - **Authentication Implementation:** Bumble added authentication mechanisms to secure API endpoints and restrict access to authorized users.
  - **ID Randomization:** The platform transitioned to using randomized identifiers to prevent enumeration and bulk data harvesting.
  - **Function-Level Controls:** Bumble tightened function-level access controls to ensure that only authorized users could perform sensitive operations.

- **Additional Measures:**
  - **Data Exposure Controls:** The platform adjusted its API responses to limit the amount of sensitive information exposed, addressing issues of excessive data exposure.

**4. Lessons Learned**

- **Strengthening Authentication and Authorization:**
  - **Authentication Controls:** Implement robust authentication measures to secure API endpoints and prevent unauthorized access.
  - **Authorization Controls:** Apply granular permissions to ensure users can only access or perform actions within their designated roles.

- **Improving Data Security Practices:**
  - **ID Randomization:** Use randomized or obfuscated identifiers to make it harder for attackers to guess and access user data.
  - **Data Minimization:** Limit the exposure of sensitive data through APIs to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data misuse.

- **Incident Response:**
  - **Timely Remediation:** Address vulnerabilities promptly and implement necessary security measures to protect user data.
  - **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly review and test APIs for security vulnerabilities to ensure ongoing protection and compliance with best practices.
