**1. Overview of the Experian Incident**

- **Platform:** Experian, a leading credit reporting agency.
- **Incident:** A significant breach occurred due to an API exposure involving third parties. Experian provided an API to financial partners for credit score retrieval, which was misused by a partner to create a publicly accessible website.

**2. Attack Mechanism**

- **API Exploit:**
  - **Broken Object Level Authorization ([API1:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/)):**
    - **Description:** The API allowed unauthorized access to credit scores based on minimal information (name, address, and date of birth). The lack of proper authorization checks enabled users to retrieve credit scores for anyone in the Experian database, regardless of the actual values provided in the query.

  - **Broken User Authentication ([API2:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa2-broken-authentication/)):**
    - **Description:** The API had inadequate authentication measures, allowing any user to access sensitive data without proper validation. This lack of secure authentication contributed to the breach by enabling unauthorized access to the API.

 - **Broken Object Property Level Authorization ([API3:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa3-broken-object-property-level-authorization/)):**
    - **Description:** The API did not properly enforce authorization at the property level of the object being accessed. Even though users were authenticated, the API allowed access to any user's credit score data without verifying the ownership or permissions for the specific properties being requested. This issue highlights the failure to restrict access based on the property level within the object, leading to excessive data exposure.

  - **Improper Inventory Management ([API9:2023](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa9-improper-inventory-management/)):**
    - **Description:** The breach exposed a lack of control and visibility over the APIâ€™s usage and deployment. Experian was unaware that their API, intended for financial partners, was being used on a publicly accessible website. This lack of oversight led to unauthorized access and misuse of the API.

**3. Impact and Response**

- **Impact:**
  - **Data Exposure:** The API allowed anyone with basic information to access the credit records of individuals in the Experian database. This breach exposed sensitive financial information and posed significant risks to privacy and security.
  - **Third-Party Risk:** The incident underscores the risks associated with third-party integrations. The unintended exposure of the API through a partner's website led to a significant breach.

- **Response:**
  - **Incident Handling:** Experian needed to address the vulnerability by securing the API and restricting access to authorized users only. This involved revoking or securing API endpoints and ensuring that third parties adhere to strict security practices.
  - **Security Improvements:** Measures were likely taken to enhance oversight of API usage and ensure that APIs are not misused by unauthorized parties. This includes better monitoring, access controls, and inventory management to prevent similar incidents.

**4. Lessons Learned**

- **Improving API Security:**
  - **Authorization and Access Controls:** Implement robust authorization checks to ensure that APIs only provide access to data for which users are authorized. This involves verifying that API requests are legitimate and enforcing strict access controls.
  - **Authentication Measures:** Strengthen authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data. Implement secure authentication practices, such as multi-factor authentication, to protect APIs from unauthorized access.
  - **Property-Level Authorization:** Ensure that access controls are enforced at the property level of the object being accessed. This means implementing fine-grained authorization checks to restrict access based on the specific properties requested, rather than just the object as a whole.
  - **Inventory and Oversight:** Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all APIs, including their intended use and any third-party integrations. Ensure that all APIs are monitored and managed to prevent unauthorized access and misuse.
  - **Data Exposure Controls:** Implement data exposure controls to prevent sensitive information from being accessible through APIs. Use proper filtering, data masking, and validation to ensure that APIs do not expose unnecessary or sensitive data.

- **Effective Third-Party Management:**
  - **Vendor Security:** Ensure that third-party partners comply with security standards and have appropriate measures in place to protect APIs from misuse. Regularly audit and review third-party integrations to ensure they meet security requirements.
  - **Access Restrictions:** Implement controls to restrict API access and usage based on the intended audience and purpose. Ensure that APIs used by partners are securely integrated and not exposed to unauthorized users.
