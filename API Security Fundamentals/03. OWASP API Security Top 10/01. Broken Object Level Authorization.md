**Broken Object Level Authorization** is the most critical issue on the OWASP API Security Top 10 due to its prevalence and potential impact. This vulnerability occurs when an attacker manipulates object IDs or other identifiers to access records that do not belong to them. It often results in unauthorized data access, manipulation, or disclosure.

**Example:** An attacker logs in as User A and attempts to access or modify records belonging to User B. If successful, the attacker can potentially access or manipulate a large volume of data.

**Prevention:** To mitigate this risk, it's essential to:

1. **Define and Enforce Access Controls:** Clearly outline and enforce access control policies at the application logic layer, not just within the UI or API endpoints.
   
2. **Implement Automated Testing:** Conduct continuous and comprehensive testing throughout the development lifecycle. Regularly test for access control vulnerabilities, particularly with each release or addition of new functionality to the application.
