**Broken Authentication** is a critical issue in the OWASP API Security Top 10 due to its frequent occurrence and severe consequences. This vulnerability involves weak or inadequate authentication mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

**Examples of Weak Authentication:**
- **Weak Password Policies:** Insufficient complexity or length requirements.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Exploiting stolen credentials from other breaches.
- **Brute Force Attacks:** Attempting to guess passwords or IDs.
- **Lack of Rate Limiting:** No limits on login attempts or API requests.
- **Absence of CAPTCHAs or Lockouts:** No protections against automated attacks.
- **Insecure Credential Storage:** Poor practices for storing passwords and tokens.
- **Authentication Info in URLs:** Sensitive data exposed in URLs, which can be intercepted.
- **Unauthenticated Password Changes:** Allowing password changes without proper verification.

**Prevention:**
1. **Define Authentication Requirements:** Set authentication standards based on the sensitivity of the data or functionality. Implement strong authentication mechanisms for sensitive endpoints.
   
2. **Implement Strong Protections:** Use rate limiting, CAPTCHAs, and account lockouts to defend against brute force and credential stuffing attacks. Ensure secure storage and transmission of credentials.

3. **Continuous Testing:** Regularly test authentication mechanisms to detect vulnerabilities introduced by new code or infrastructure changes.
