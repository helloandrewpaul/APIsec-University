**Broken Object Property Level Authorization** is a new category in the OWASP API Security Top 10 for 2023, evolving from the previous concepts of **Mass Assignment** and **Excessive Data Exposure**.

**Description:**
- **Mass Assignment:** This vulnerability arises when an API allows users to modify object properties beyond what is intended. For example, an attacker might change an account’s status from free to premium by altering fields they shouldn’t have access to.
  
- **Excessive Data Exposure:** This issue occurs when an API endpoint returns more data than necessary. For instance, an API designed for user search might inadvertently expose sensitive details like account IDs and email addresses, even though only basic user information is needed.

**Prevention:**
1. **Data Filtering and Validation:** Ensure that APIs return only the data required for the specific application use case. Implement server-side filtering to prevent sensitive information from being exposed through API responses.
   
2. **Access Controls:** Enforce strict authorization rules to ensure that users can only access and modify the data they are permitted to. This means validating and restricting data modifications based on user roles and permissions.

3. **Continuous Testing:** Regularly test APIs to identify and address vulnerabilities related to data exposure and unauthorized property modifications. This includes both automated tests and manual reviews to ensure that data handling aligns with security policies and use case requirements.\
