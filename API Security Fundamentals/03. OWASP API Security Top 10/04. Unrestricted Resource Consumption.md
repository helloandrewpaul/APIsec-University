**Unrestricted Resource Consumption** focuses on vulnerabilities that lead to excessive consumption of system resources, often resulting in data loss, denial of service, and operational disruptions. This category replaces the former **Lack of Resources and Rate Limiting**.

**Description:**
- **High-Volume Data Harvesting:** Attackers exploit APIs to perform mass data extraction. For instance, a lack of rate limiting might allow a user to make thousands of queries, leading to large-scale data harvesting.
  
- **Denial of Service:** Inadequate resource constraints can result in performance issues or outages. Examples include excessive file uploads or operations in a single request, which can overwhelm servers.

**Examples:**
1. **Missing Rate Controls:** Allowing excessive API requests beyond typical usage, such as a user querying data thousands of times.
2. **Inadequate Timeouts and Limits:** Not imposing limits on memory usage, file sizes, or request complexity, leading to potential server overload and slowdowns.
3. **Large Data Responses:** Returning massive volumes of records in a single API response, which can impact performance and expose large amounts of data.

**Prevention:**
1. **Implement Traffic Controls:** Utilize web application firewalls (WAFs) and API gateways to enforce rate limits and prevent abuse. This helps manage the volume of incoming requests and reduces the risk of overload.
   
2. **Apply Application-Level Logic:** Design your application to handle unexpected volumes of requests gracefully. For example, limit the number of attempts for sensitive operations like password resets and implement controls to disable features after a threshold of failed attempts.

3. **Regular Testing:** Continuously test your APIs for resource consumption vulnerabilities. Automated tools and stress tests can help identify potential issues before they impact users or operational stability.
