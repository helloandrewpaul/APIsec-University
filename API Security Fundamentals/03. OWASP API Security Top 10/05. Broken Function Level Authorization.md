**Broken Function Level Authorization** involves improper control over which users can access specific functions or perform actions within an API. It carries over from the previous OWASP API Top 10 and remains a critical concern for ensuring that users only have access to the functions and data they are authorized to handle.

**Description:**
- **Unauthorized Function Access:** Attackers may exploit APIs by attempting unauthorized operations. For example, they might replace a benign GET request with a PUT or DELETE request to perform actions that should be restricted, like modifying or deleting records.

**Examples:**
1. **Method Substitution:** Changing a GET request to PUT or DELETE to see if it performs unauthorized actions, such as upgrading user roles or deleting data.
2. **Privilege Escalation:** Manipulating API endpoints to gain access to functionalities reserved for higher-privileged users, like administrative actions.

**Prevention:**
1. **Strict Function Authorization:** Implement fine-grained access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive functions. Each API endpoint should be protected based on user roles and permissions.

2. **Endpoint Testing:** Continuously test all API endpoints to verify that unauthorized users cannot access restricted functionalities. This includes testing different request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to ensure proper access controls are enforced.

3. **Regular Reviews:** Regularly review and audit your API functions and authorization mechanisms to identify and address any potential gaps. Ensure that changes in user roles or application features are reflected in the access controls and tested thoroughly.
