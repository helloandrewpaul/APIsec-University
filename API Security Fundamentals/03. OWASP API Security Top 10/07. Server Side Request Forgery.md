**Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a new addition to the 2023 OWASP API Security Top 10. It highlights vulnerabilities where APIs that accept URLs as input can be exploited to access unauthorized resources or perform malicious actions.

**Description:**
- **Vulnerability:** APIs that take URLs as input parameters can be tricked into accessing internal resources or external malicious sites. This can lead to unauthorized data access or exposure to harmful payloads.

**Examples:**
1. **Internal Resource Access:** An attacker might input a URL like `/localhost/api/user-data` into an endpoint that accepts URLs, tricking the server into accessing sensitive internal resources and potentially returning that data to the attacker.
   
2. **Malicious Sites:** Alternatively, an attacker could input a URL pointing to a malicious site, leading the server to download malware or other harmful content.

**Prevention:**
1. **Validate and Sanitize Inputs:** Ensure all user-supplied URLs are strictly validated and sanitized. Only allow URLs that meet the specific criteria expected by your application (e.g., proper format for LinkedIn addresses).

2. **Filter and Block Malicious Inputs:** Implement filters to block any URLs or input that do not conform to the expected patterns. Avoid trusting user input blindly.

3. **Testing and Fuzzing:** Conduct thorough testing and fuzzing of your APIs to ensure they handle all types of inputs securely and do not process or access unauthorized resources.
