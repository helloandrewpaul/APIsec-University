**Improper Inventory Management** highlights the risks associated with not having a comprehensive and accurate view of your API environment.

**Description:**
- **Vulnerability:** Improper Inventory Management occurs when there is a lack of oversight and control over the APIs within your environment. This includes not tracking all active APIs, endpoints, versions, and their respective access controls. Attackers often exploit older or deprecated versions of APIs that may still be accessible and contain unpatched vulnerabilities.

**Examples:**
1. **Old Versions:** Legacy API versions that remain accessible after a new version is released, potentially containing vulnerabilities that were addressed in the latest version.
   
2. **Unpatched Endpoints:** Outdated API endpoints that still have known security issues and are not updated or retired properly.

3. **Lack of Visibility:** Not having a complete and accurate inventory of all API endpoints, versions, and their usage.

**Prevention:**
1. **API Management:** Use an API Gateway to manage and monitor all APIs, ensuring they go through proper approval, testing, and validation processes before going live.

2. **Version Control:** Establish clear rules for versioning and retiring APIs, including communication procedures for updating users and deprecating older versions.

3. **Auditing and Monitoring:** Regularly audit and monitor API access to ensure that only authorized users have access to the necessary versions and endpoints. 

4. **Documentation:** Maintain accurate and up-to-date documentation of all APIs, including versions and access permissions, to prevent unauthorized access and ensure proper management.
