**Unsafe Consumption of APIs** is a newly added category to the OWASP API Security Top 10, focusing on the risks associated with using third-party APIs.

**Description:**
- **Vulnerability:** Unsafe Consumption of APIs involves the risks that arise from integrating and relying on third-party APIs. These APIs can introduce vulnerabilities into your system if they are not properly vetted or secured. The exposure can lead to data theft, breaches, or unauthorized access.

**Examples:**
1. **Malicious Data Injection:** An attacker might insert malicious data into a third-party API, which is then pulled into your system. For example, an attacker could input harmful commands into an address verification API, which could then compromise your application when that data is used.

2. **Abused URL Redirects:** A third-party API might include instructions to redirect to other URLs. If not properly managed, this can be exploited to redirect users to malicious sites or perform unauthorized actions.

**Prevention:**
1. **Data Validation:** Ensure that all data received from third-party APIs is validated and sanitized before being used in your application. Do not blindly trust input from external sources.

2. **Evaluate Third-Party Security:** Regularly assess the security practices of third-party API providers. Ensure they implement proper security controls, testing, and encryption.

3. **Inventory and Auditing:** Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all third-party APIs in use and conduct regular audits to ensure their security and compliance with your standards.
