### Governance

The benefits of governance are about establishing consistency in how your APIs are developed, deployed, and tested. This includes setting expectations for your engineering team—what documentation requirements, authentication policies, and versioning are needed. It also involves establishing standard processes for how APIs move from development to production, ensuring that everything goes through the same level of security assessment and vetting.

**Components of Governance**

1. **Awareness:**
   - **Understanding your APIs:** Know what APIs you have, their infrastructure, data access, and associated risks.
   - **Comprehensive View:** Understand your app architecture, containers, virtual machines, databases, and network infrastructure.
   - **Standard Deployment:** Ensure APIs are deployed in approved ways with proper validation, avoiding “shadow” or “rogue” APIs.

2. **Policy and Process:**
   - **Documentation Requirements:** Make API documentation mandatory for development, third-party integration, and security testing. Define design guides for consistent and reusable API development.
   - **Risk and Threat Modeling:** Assess vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and third-party access. Understand the nature and value of your data to prioritize risks and define response plans.

**Documentation**

Documentation is crucial for security, development, and enabling API use. The Open API Specification (OAS), formerly known as Swagger, is the industry standard for documenting REST APIs. It supports integration, testing, and runtime monitoring.

- **Control Documentation:** Ensure only necessary information is published publicly. Regularly retire outdated documentation to avoid security risks.
- **Generate Specifications:** Automate the generation of API documentation through code repositories to ensure completeness.

**Design Guide**

Establish standards for authentication, authorization, error codes, versioning, and naming conventions. Define how and where different types of authentication are used, and how access is controlled. Ensure error messages do not reveal useful information to potential attackers.

- **Authentication:** Example from Atlassian's design guide—basic user authentication and application-level authorization.

- **Versioning:** Define when to create new versions and how to handle old versions.
