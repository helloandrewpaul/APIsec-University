### Testing

The goal here is to ensure your APIs are free of vulnerabilities and lack business logic flaws. The first question is whether to find API vulnerabilities pre-production or in production. Best practice is to integrate security testing into your overall testing program. Every line of code should be tested for functionality, unit testing, performance, and security as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

**Standard Playbook vs. API-First Testing**

The standard security tests include cross-site scripting, injections, and buffer overflow attacks. While these are important, real-world breaches often result from logic flaws rather than these common vulnerabilities. Hence, your testing program should go beyond the standard playbook to include unique functionality testing for your application.

**API-First Testing**

API-First testing focuses on the API layer itself, rather than just the UI layer. Attackers often bypass the UI and target the API directly. Corey Ball, author of "Hacking APIs," emphasizes that breaches are more likely due to issues like lack of authentication and authorization rather than UI layer abuses. This is why API-First testing is crucial.

**Types of Testing**

1. **Security Testing:**
   - Endpoints and authentication exploits
   - Enumeration (e.g., incrementing IDs)
   - Rate limit issues
   - Lack of encryption
   - Fuzzing
   - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
   - Properties leaks

2. **Data Security Testing:**
   - Access controls and gaps
   - Data exposure and encryption
   - File structures and directories
   - Data exfiltration risks

3. **Business Logic Testing:**
   - Business flow abuse
   - Access control enforcement
   - Regular and automated penetration testing
