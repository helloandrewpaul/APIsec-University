### Monitoring

Monitoring in API security refers to the continuous process of observing and analyzing API interactions and performance in real time to detect, respond to, and mitigate security threats and operational issues. It involves deploying tools and practices that provide visibility into API behavior, enforce security policies, detect anomalies, and facilitate incident response.

**Runtime Protection**

Runtime protection involves active measures to protect your APIs. This includes:
- **Policy Enforcement:** Requiring authentication to access endpoints.
- **Traffic Filtering:** Implementing geographic traffic filters (e.g., only accepting traffic from specific regions or IP addresses).

**Threat Detection**

Effective threat detection involves:
- **Analyzing Traffic:** Look for fraudulent transactions, abnormal traffic patterns, and distributed attacks from multiple sources.
- **Incident Response:** Capture and log all traffic to analyze incidents and implement mitigating controls for future attacks.

**Validate Controls**

Ensure that all implemented controls (at the gateway, firewall, and application levels) are functioning as intended. Identify and address any anomalies or unexpected traffic patterns.

**Approaches to Runtime Monitoring**

1. **Proactive Blocking:**
   - **Gateways and Firewalls:** Enforce policies such as authentication requirements or rate limiting.
   - **Blocking Traffic:** Traffic that doesnâ€™t match defined rules is blocked.

2. **Reactive Alerting:**
   - **Logging and Alerting:** Capture traffic and log it in a SIEM or API threat management tool.
   - **Contextual Analysis:** Alerts help identify potential issues, but be cautious of false positives and ensure you can understand and review traffic context.

**API Discovery**

Monitoring can help with API discovery by:
- **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Identifying active APIs and endpoints.
- **Limitations:** Discovery is not always comprehensive; APIs inside firewalls or not actively used might not be detected.


For a complete API inventory, combine network monitoring with code repository scans, crawling, and application testing. Use a centralized management tool like an API gateway to ensure comprehensive visibility.

**Visibility Limitations**

Live traffic monitoring may have limited context and might miss active attacks. For example, inline tools might not discern if a transaction is legitimate based on account ownership. Authorization should be handled at the application logic level.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Simulate Attacks:** Test for vulnerabilities before going live and apply necessary corrections.
- **Privacy and Performance:** Be cautious of sharing traffic data with third parties, which could impact privacy, bandwidth, or latency.
