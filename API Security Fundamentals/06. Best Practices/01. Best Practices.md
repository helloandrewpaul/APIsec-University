**Governance**: Ensure you have well-defined policies, standards, and processes for managing APIs. No API should go live without thorough documentation, testing, security validation, and compliance with established procedures. Implementing these governance practices through a gateway can help enforce consistency and management across all APIs.

**Comprehensive Testing**: Develop a robust testing program that covers every attack vector and endpoint. Test all data objects, user types, functions, and methods across a multitude of scenarios. Utilize automation to integrate comprehensive testing into your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that every release undergoes rigorous evaluation. Continuous testing is essential to identify vulnerabilities that may arise from code or infrastructure changes.  

**Metrics and Monitoring**: Track your progress by setting up metrics to measure vulnerability discovery, mitigation speed, and other critical factors. Regularly review and refine your processes based on these metrics to improve your security posture.

**Dos and Don’ts**

- **Don’t Trust Anything**: Validate all inputs to your API to ensure they match expected formats and discard any that do not. Avoid trusting inputs or the network implicitly.  
- **Don’t Confuse Obfuscation with Security**: Obfuscating code does not make it secure. Ensure sensitive data like keys and tokens are not hard-coded into your codebase.  
- **Don’t Reveal Useful Info in Error Messages**: Limit the information disclosed in error messages to avoid providing attackers with clues that could help them exploit vulnerabilities.  
- **Don’t Have Hidden or Unadvertised Features**: Ensure that all features and endpoints are documented and controlled. Avoid relying on users to discover undocumented or hidden APIs.  
- **Don’t Filter Data in the UI**: Filtering and controlling access to data should be handled by the application logic, not the UI. The UI’s role is to present data, not to enforce security controls.  
- **Don’t Confuse Authentication with Authorization**: Authentication verifies identity, while authorization controls access to resources. Ensure your application manages what users can see and do based on their credentials.  
- **Do Use API Gateways**: Centralize traffic control and management through API gateways to enforce consistent policies and protections across all APIs.  
- **Do Require API Documentation**: Ensure that your APIs are properly documented for both internal use and security purposes. Good documentation is crucial for testing and validating API functionality.  
- **Do Expect Hackers to Find and Use Those Undocumented Endpoints**: Be proactive in securing all endpoints, including those that may not be documented.  
- **Do Continuous Tests**: Perform continuous testing on every release, simulate attacks, evaluate configurations, and test authentication and authorization.
